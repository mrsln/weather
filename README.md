# Weather app

I wrote it as a technical task for a job. Then I realised how fun it is to know the temperature in
other parts of the world.

Sometimes I use this project to try new features in the React world.

Currently it can:

  * add a city
  * remove a city
  * help you spell a city name
  * detect your city
  
The list of technologies and approaches:

  * react
  * redux
  * webpack
  * hot reloading
  * es6, es7
  * localStorage (instant reloading)
  * flexbox (try to resize)

For the server side I wrote a simple Go application and run it on Heroku.

# Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Ideas ##

  * [instant web application](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/instant-web-application/)
  * switch to a better weather API (yahoo, weather.com)
  * speed up the city search API
  * somehow show if it's raining, snowing or just cloudy
  * show pictures of the city (from flickr, instagram or webcams)
  * dnd for sorting
  * editing existing city
